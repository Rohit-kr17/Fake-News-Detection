# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting fake news using a dataset consisting of articles from various sources. The project aims to differentiate between real and fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# About
Fake news has become a significant challenge in the modern age of information overload. This project explores the use of machine learning to automatically classify news articles as either fake or real based on their content. By leveraging NLP techniques and a labeled dataset, the goal is to build a model that can assist in identifying unreliable sources.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files:

fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.
true.csv: Contains real news articles.
manualtesting.csv: Contains a set of articles for manual testing of the model.
The dataset is preprocessed and used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

# Usage
Place the fake.csv and true.csv files in the data directory.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (fake_news_detection.ipynb or fake_news_detection.py) to train and evaluate the model.
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data, such as the articles in the manualtesting.csv file.

# Results
The results of the fake news detection model can be found in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script. The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are presented along with any visualizations that provide insights into the model's behavior.
